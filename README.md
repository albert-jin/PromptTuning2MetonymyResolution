> PromptMR: Adapting Prompt Learning to Metonymy Resolution

```
How many surprises it can bring us when adapting the Prompt Learning paradigm to the Metonymy Resolution task?
```
## Contributions

> ***PromptMRs*** are the first also systematic explorations that adapt the prompt-tuning
paradigm to the NLP Metonymy Resolution research area.

> Extensive experiments prove that when compared with previous
SOTA methods for Metonymy Resolution, the Prompt Learning methods
are still sufficiently competitive. Concretely, our Prompt Learning based
Metonymy Resolution methods perform fairly well in terms of training convergence efficiency and final classification performance over previous SOTA
methods, both in data-sufficient (i.e. full-data training) and data-scarce (i.e.
few-shot) scenarios.
